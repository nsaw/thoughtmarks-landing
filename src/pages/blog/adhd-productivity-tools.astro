          Most productivity advice is written by neurotypical people for neurotypical people. 
          "Just write it down!" "Make a list!" "Set a reminder!" As if we haven't tried that 
          a thousand times. Here's what actually works for ADHD brains.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">The ADHD Paradox</h3>
          <p class="text-zinc-300">
            ADHD doesn't mean you can't focus—it means you can't choose what to focus on. 
            You have <em>more</em> thoughts than average, not fewer. The problem isn't having ideas; 
            it's that they arrive at inconvenient times and vanish before you can act on them.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Why Traditional Tools Fail</h2>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          Before we talk about what works, let's acknowledge why conventional productivity 
          tools often don't:
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-4 my-6">
          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-red-500/20 rounded-xl p-4">
            <p class="text-white font-bold mb-1">❌ "Write it in your notebook"</p>
            <p class="text-zinc-400 text-sm">Notebook isn't with you. Or you'll lose the notebook. Or you'll start 47 notebooks and never look at any of them again.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-red-500/20 rounded-xl p-4">
            <p class="text-white font-bold mb-1">❌ "Organize it in folders"</p>
            <p class="text-zinc-400 text-sm">Deciding which folder takes so long the idea is gone. Also, you won't remember which folder later.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-red-500/20 rounded-xl p-4">
            <p class="text-white font-bold mb-1">❌ "Set a reminder"</p>
            <p class="text-zinc-400 text-sm">You'll set 50 reminders, ignore all of them, and feel guilty about it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-red-500/20 rounded-xl p-4">
            <p class="text-white font-bold mb-1">❌ "Build a second brain system"</p>
            <p class="text-zinc-400 text-sm">You'll hyperfocus on building the perfect system for 3 weeks, then abandon it entirely.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The ADHD-Friendly Tool Framework</h2>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          Tools that actually work for ADHD brains share certain properties:
        </p>

        <div class="grid gap-6 my-8">
          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent mb-2">1. Zero Decisions Required</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              Every decision point is a chance to get distracted or give up. The best tools 
              eliminate choices: one button, one action, done. No "where should this go?" 
              No "how should I tag this?" Just capture and move on.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent mb-2">2. Works in Under 5 Seconds</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              ADHD working memory is shorter than neurotypical working memory. If your tool 
              takes 10+ seconds to use, you've lost the thought. Voice capture beats typing 
              because you can get the idea out before it evaporates.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent mb-2">3. Always Within Reach</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              Shower thoughts. Driving epiphanies. 3am revelations. If the capture tool 
              isn't there in that moment, the idea is lost. Wearables, voice assistants, 
              and always-on devices matter more for ADHD than for others.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent mb-2">4. Forgives Chaos</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              Your capture will be messy. Half-sentences, tangents, random observations. 
              The tool should handle chaos gracefully—ideally, with AI that makes sense 
              of the mess so you don't have to.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent mb-2">5. Finds Things You Half-Remember</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              "That thing I thought about last week about the project..." ADHD memory is 
              associative and approximate. Search that requires exact keywords fails. 
              Semantic search that understands meaning succeeds.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Tools Worth Trying</h2>

        <div class="space-y-6 my-8">
          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">For Idea Capture: Voice-First Apps</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300 mb-3">
              Voice capture is transformative for ADHD. Speaking is faster than typing, 
              requires less executive function, and preserves the natural flow of thought.
            </p>
            <p class="text-accent font-semibold">
              Try: Thoughtmarks, Otter, Voice Memos (but Thoughtmarks adds AI organization)
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">For Task Management: Body Doubling Apps</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300 mb-3">
              Working alongside others (even virtually) helps ADHD brains maintain focus. 
              Body doubling apps create that accountability without requiring actual coordination.
            </p>
            <p class="text-zinc-500 font-semibold">
              Try: Focusmate, Flow Club, or even just Discord study channels
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">For Time Awareness: Visual Timers</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300 mb-3">
              Time blindness is real. Visual timers that show time passing (not just counting) 
              help ADHD brains develop time awareness.
            </p>
            <p class="text-zinc-500 font-semibold">
              Try: Time Timer app, Visual Timer on Apple Watch
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">For Focus: Distraction Blockers</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300 mb-3">
              ADHD impulse control is weak. Remove the temptation entirely rather than 
              relying on willpower. Block distracting sites and apps automatically.
            </p>
            <p class="text-zinc-500 font-semibold">
              Try: Freedom, Cold Turkey, Screen Time (built into iOS)
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Anti-Advice</h2>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          What NOT to do:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-zinc-300 space-y-2 my-6">
          <li>• <strong class="text-white">Don't try to build the perfect system.</strong> You'll hyperfocus on the system instead of using it.</li>
          <li>• <strong class="text-white">Don't add more tools.</strong> Each new tool is another thing to remember to use.</li>
          <li>• <strong class="text-white">Don't fight your brain.</strong> Work with how it functions, not against it.</li>
          <li>• <strong class="text-white">Don't feel guilty about "messy" capture.</strong> Messy but captured beats elegant and forgotten.</li>
        </ul>

            Thoughtmarks was built by a woodworking, filmmaking computer nerd with ADHD: 
            5-second voice capture, zero organization required, AI that handles the mess, and semantic search for half-remembered ideas.
