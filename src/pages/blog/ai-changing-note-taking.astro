          For decades, note-taking followed the same pattern: you write it, you file it, you (maybe) 
          find it later. AI is flipping this paradigm entirely. Here's what's changing and why it matters.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Old Paradigm: Human as Organizer</h2>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          Traditional note-taking put all the organizational burden on you:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-zinc-300 space-y-2 my-6">
          <li>• Choose which folder/notebook</li>
          <li>• Decide what tags to use</li>
          <li>• Create titles and headings</li>
          <li>• Manually link related notes</li>
          <li>• Remember your filing system months later</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          This works fine if you're methodical, consistent, and have time to maintain the system. 
          For everyone else, it meant notes went into a black hole—captured but effectively lost.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The New Paradigm: AI as Organizer</h2>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          Modern AI changes the equation fundamentally. Instead of you organizing for the computer 
          to retrieve, the computer organizes for you to retrieve.
        </p>

        <div class="grid gap-6 my-8">
          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent mb-2">Automatic Tagging</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              AI reads your note and assigns relevant tags based on content, context, and concepts. 
              Not just keywords—actual understanding. "Call mom about her birthday" gets tagged 
              with family, reminders, events—without you lifting a finger.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent mb-2">Smart Categorization</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              Instead of rigid folders, AI creates dynamic categories based on your actual content. 
              These categories emerge organically from what you capture, not from a system you 
              have to maintain.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent mb-2">Connection Discovery</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              AI finds relationships between notes you'd never notice. That idea from three months 
              ago is conceptually related to what you captured today—AI surfaces this connection 
              automatically.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent mb-2">Semantic Search</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              Search by meaning, not exact words. "That marketing psychology thing" finds your 
              note about "loss aversion in pricing." You describe what you remember; AI finds 
              what matches.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">What This Enables</h2>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          These capabilities combine to enable a completely different workflow:
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-accent/10 to-accent/5 border border-accent/20 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-4">The Capture-First Workflow</h3>
          <ol class="text-zinc-300 space-y-3">
            <li><strong class="text-accent">1. Capture everything.</strong> Don't filter, don't organize, just capture. Voice, text, whatever's fastest.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-accent">2. Trust the system.</strong> AI handles the organization. You don't need to know "where" something went.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-accent">3. Find by meaning.</strong> When you need something, describe it. Search understands concepts, not just keywords.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-accent">4. Discover connections.</strong> AI shows you relationships between ideas you'd never have linked yourself.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Technology Behind It</h2>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          Three AI technologies make this possible:
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-6 my-8">
          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">1. Large Language Models (LLMs)</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              GPT-4 and similar models understand the meaning and context of text at a near-human 
              level. They can read a note and understand what it's about, what topics it relates to, 
              and how it connects to other concepts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">2. Vector Embeddings</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              Every piece of text can be converted into a high-dimensional vector that represents 
              its meaning. Similar ideas have similar vectors, enabling semantic search and 
              connection discovery based on conceptual similarity.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-zinc-900/50 border border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">3. Speech Recognition</h3>
            <p class="text-zinc-300">
              Whisper and similar models transcribe speech with remarkable accuracy. Combined with 
              LLMs, this enables voice-first capture that's automatically formatted and organized.
            </p>
          </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">What's Coming Next</h2>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          The AI note-taking revolution is just beginning. Emerging capabilities include:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-zinc-300 space-y-2 my-6">
          <li>• <strong class="text-white">Proactive surfacing:</strong> AI that brings relevant past notes to your attention when they become useful</li>
          <li>• <strong class="text-white">Synthesis:</strong> AI that can summarize and combine insights from across your notes</li>
          <li>• <strong class="text-white">Question answering:</strong> Ask questions about your own knowledge base and get accurate answers</li>
          <li>• <strong class="text-white">Predictive tagging:</strong> AI that learns your personal vocabulary and concepts over time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Human Element</h2>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          AI doesn't replace thinking—it amplifies it. By handling the organizational overhead, 
          AI frees you to focus on what humans do best: having insights, making connections, 
          and creating new ideas.
        </p>

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
          The best note-taking AI is invisible. You capture thoughts naturally, AI works in 
          the background, and when you need something, it's there. No system to maintain, 
          no organization homework—just you and your ideas.
