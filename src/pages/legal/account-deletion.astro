  <h2 id="before-you-delete">4. Before You Delete</h2>
  
  <h3>Export Your Data</h3>
  <p>
    We recommend exporting your data before deleting your account. 
    Go to <strong>Settings → Data → Export All Data</strong> to download a copy of your Thoughtmarks.
  </p>

  <h3>Cancel Subscription First</h3>
  <p>
    If you have a premium subscription, cancel it through your Apple ID settings 
    to avoid continued billing. Deleting your Thoughtmarks account does not 
    automatically cancel App Store subscriptions.
  </p>

  <h2 id="apple-watch">5. Apple Watch Data</h2>
  <p>
    Data stored on your Apple Watch is automatically removed when you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete the watch app</li>
    <li>Unpair your Apple Watch</li>
    <li>Delete your Thoughtmarks account</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="reactivation">6. Can I Reactivate?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>No.</strong> Once your account is deleted, it cannot be recovered. 
    If you want to use Thoughtmarks again, you'll need to create a new account.
  </p>

  <h2 id="legal-obligations">7. Legal Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    In some cases, we may be required to retain certain information to comply with 
    legal obligations (such as tax records or fraud prevention). This data is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Minimized to only what is legally required</li>
    <li>Stored securely and separately from active user data</li>
    <li>Deleted when the legal retention period expires</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="contact">8. Questions?</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about account deletion or data privacy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Privacy Team:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@thoughtmarks.app">privacy@thoughtmarks.app</a></li>
    <li><strong>Support:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@thoughtmarks.app">support@thoughtmarks.app</a></li>

  <div class="legal-success">
