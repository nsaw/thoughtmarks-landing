# Privacy Manifest Evidence - P7 Slice-07.9

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Phase**: P7 - Payments & IAP Go-Live Readiness  
**Status**: Validated

---

## Overview

This document provides evidence that our Privacy Manifest (PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy) accurately reflects actual SDK usage and declared API usage in our iOS app.

---

## Privacy Manifest Location

**Path**: `/ios/thoughtmarks/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`

**Format**: Apple Property List (plist) XML

---

## Declared vs. Used Analysis

### Third-Party SDKs Installed

| SDK | Version | Privacy Types | Required APIs |
|-----|---------|---------------|---------------|
| @sentry/react-native | ~6.20.0 | crash_reporting, performance_monitoring | UserDefaults, FileTimestamp |
| @react-native-community/netinfo | ^11.4.1 | connectivity_monitoring | None |
| expo-local-authentication | ~17.0.7 | biometric_authentication | None |

### Info.plist Declared APIs

The following usage descriptions are declared in Info.plist:

1. **NSCameraUsageDescription**: "Allow Thoughtmarks to capture images for your thoughts"
2. **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription**: "Allow Thoughtmarks to record voice notes"
3. **NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription**: "Location helps organize and contextualize your thoughts"
4. **NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription**: "Background location enables automatic context detection"
5. **NSUserTrackingUsageDescription**: "This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you"
6. **NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription**: "Access photos to attach to your thoughts"

### Privacy Manifest Accessed API Types

Currently declared in Privacy Manifest:
- NSUserDefaults (4 types)
- File timestamp access
- System boot time
- Disk space

### Gap Analysis

#### ⚠️ Warnings (Address Before App Store Submission)

1. **Sentry NSUserDefaults API**: Sentry SDK uses UserDefaults but not explicitly declared in Privacy Manifest
   - **Action**: Add NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType entry for UserDefaults with reason code
   
2. **Sentry NSFileTimestamp API**: Sentry SDK accesses file timestamps but not declared
   - **Action**: Add NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType entry for FileTimestamp access

3. **Microphone Usage**: NSMicrophoneUsageDescription declared in Info.plist but corresponding Privacy Manifest entry may be needed
   - **Action**: Review if microphone access requires Required Reason API declaration

4. **Camera Usage**: NSCameraUsageDescription declared in Info.plist but corresponding Privacy Manifest entry may be needed
   - **Action**: Review if camera access requires Required Reason API declaration

---

## Validation Results

**Validator Script**: `src-nextgen/guards/privacy-manifest-validator.cjs`

**Run Date**: 2025-10-08

**Result**: ⚠️ PASS WITH WARNINGS

**Summary**:
- Privacy Manifest exists and is parsable
- Third-party SDKs properly identified
- Info.plist declarations complete
- Minor warnings for Sentry API declarations

---

## Recommendations

### Before App Store Submission

1. **Update Privacy Manifest** to include:
   ```xml
   <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes</key>
   <array>
     <dict>
       <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType</key>
       <string>NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults</string>
       <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons</key>
       <array>
         <string>CA92.1</string> <!-- Crash reporting -->
       </array>
     </dict>
     <dict>
       <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType</key>
       <string>NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryFileTimestamp</string>
       <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons</key>
       <array>
         <string>C617.1</string> <!-- File modification tracking -->
       </array>
     </dict>
   </array>
   ```

2. **Review Microphone/Camera** declarations - ensure Required Reason API declarations are complete if these APIs are accessed

3. **Run validator** again after updates: `node src-nextgen/guards/privacy-manifest-validator.cjs`

## Screenshots/IDs

**Validator Output**: See `/validations/logs/privacy-manifest-validation.log`

**CI Integration**: Add to pre-submission checks

## Compliance Status

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Privacy Manifest exists | ✅ PASS | Located in ios/thoughtmarks/ |
| SDKs properly declared | ⚠️ WARN | Sentry needs API type declarations |
| Info.plist alignment | ✅ PASS | All declared APIs documented |
| Required Reason APIs | ⚠️ WARN | Sentry APIs need explicit reasons |
| Data collection types | ✅ PASS | Crash reporting and analytics declared |

---

## Next Actions

1. Update PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy with Sentry API declarations
2. Add reason codes for UserDefaults and FileTimestamp access
3. Re-run validator to confirm all warnings resolved
4. Add to CI pipeline for continuous validation
