THOUGHTMARKS BRAND GUIDE - FONT UPDATE
Delivery Summary v2.1

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT CHANGED

Issue Identified
  The HTML brand style guide (v2.0) used a generic "cursive" font fallback
  instead of the actual tagline font. This resulted in an unprofessional
  appearance that didn't match the brand specification.
  
Resolution
  1. Tagline font officially designated as: Over the Rainbow Regular
  2. Font properly embedded in SVG brand style guide
  3. All documentation updated to reflect correct font
  4. SIL Open Font License 1.1 confirmed (free commercial use)
  
Why Over the Rainbow
  - You uploaded it, indicating it was the intended font
  - It's an acceptable alternative to Marydale (per your direction)
  - SIL OFL 1.1 license allows commercial use, embedding, distribution
  - Playful handwritten style perfect for "bookmarks for your brain!"
  - Now officially preferred over Marydale

FILE FORMATS EXPLAINED

SVG vs HTML vs AI/Figma
  
  HTML (old approach):
  ✗ Generic font fallbacks don't render properly
  ✗ Not editable in design software
  ✗ Limited to web browser viewing
  ✗ Print workflow is awkward (print to PDF)
  
  SVG (new approach):
  ✓ Opens directly in Adobe Illustrator
  ✓ Imports to Figma perfectly
  ✓ Fonts embedded and editable
  ✓ Vector format scales to any size
  ✓ Can export to any format (PDF, PNG, etc.)
  ✓ Professional design workflow
  
  Native .AI/.fig files:
  ✗ Require proprietary software to create
  ✗ Can't be generated programmatically
  ✗ SVG serves the same purpose and is more universal

Bottom Line: SVG is the professional standard for design deliverables
that need to work across multiple tools.

TROUBLESHOOTING

If Over the Rainbow Doesn't Display in Figma:
  1. Install font on your computer first
  2. Restart Figma
  3. Figma will prompt to use local font
  4. If still issues, convert text to outlines in Illustrator first

If SVG Doesn't Open in Illustrator:
  1. Make sure you have Adobe Illustrator (not just Reader)
  2. Try File > Open instead of double-clicking
  3. If "version" error, try Illustrator 2020 or newer
  4. SVG is backwards compatible, so older versions should work

If Colors Look Different:
  - Web browsers use sRGB color space
  - Illustrator/Figma may use RGB or Display P3
  - #FEFF00 is the authoritative hex code
  - Slight variations are normal across color spaces
  - For iOS, use Display P3 profile
  - For web, use sRGB profile

If You Need Another Format:
  - From Illustrator: Save As > PDF/EPS/AI
  - From Figma: Export > PDF/PNG/SVG
  - For contractors: Share view-only link or export PDF

FINAL THOUGHTS

The HTML version had a fundamental flaw - web fonts don't embed properly
in HTML without hosting infrastructure, so it fell back to generic fonts.

This SVG version solves that by:
1. Embedding the font data directly in the SVG file
2. Opening natively in professional design tools
3. Allowing full editing of all elements
4. Providing a proper workflow for creating new assets

The tagline "bookmarks for your brain!" now renders in the actual
Over the Rainbow Regular font, exactly as intended for the brand.

If you hate THIS font too, let me know and we can try another. But
the SVG format will make it much easier to swap fonts in the future.
