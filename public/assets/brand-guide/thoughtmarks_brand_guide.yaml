      - "Don't use pure black backgrounds (use warm dark #09090B)"
      - "Don't use yellow for anything except tagline script text"
      - "Don't use rounded, bubbly fonts (keep it clean and modern - Lato)"
      - "Don't clutter the icon - brain + bookmark is sufficient"
      - "Don't use light mode as default (dark is brand)"
      - "Don't avoid gradients entirely (subtle gradients with blur ARE used)"

    our_unique_value: "Speed of capture meets AI organization. No other tool optimizes for the moment of inspiration."
  
  implementation_priorities:
    phase_1_essentials:
      - "Lock down blue accent (#3B82F6) as primary interactive color"
      - "Reserve yellow (#FEFF00) for tagline script text only"
      - "Establish warm dark backgrounds (#09090B, #18181B, #27272A)"
      - "Create app store assets with consistent branding"
      - "Establish voice tone guide for all customer-facing copy"
      - "Design email templates with brand colors/fonts"
    
    phase_2_expansion:
      - "Create marketing video templates"
      - "Develop icon library for features"
      - "Build out social media templates"
      - "Design merch/swag concepts (stickers, shirts)"
    
    phase_3_scale:
      - "Create partner/press kit"
      - "Develop presentation templates"
      - "Establish brand guidelines for any contractors/agencies"
      - "Consider sub-brands if expanding product line"
  
  notes_for_founder:
    confirmed_specifications:
      primary_accent: "#3B82F6 (blue - NOT yellow)"
      brand_yellow: "#FEFF00 (tagline script text ONLY)"
      color_space: "Display P3 for iOS icon (wider gamut than sRGB)"
      icon_construction: "Multi-layer with blend modes - gradient overlay, glass effects, translucency"
      social_templates: "9:16 Instagram format with glass morphism cards"
      messaging: "Value props and how-it-works flow documented"
      typography: "Lato for UI, Over the Rainbow for tagline only"
      backgrounds: "Warm dark (#09090B) not pure black"
      gradients: "Subtle gradients with blur ARE used (contrary to old guide)"
    
    remaining_questions:
      - "Are there specific error state colors defined beyond the main palette?"
      - "Any animation/motion guidelines for the app beyond what's on landing page?"
      - "Sound design specifications for UI interactions?"
    
    recommendations:
      - "Blue (#3B82F6) is the primary interactive color - this is correct and should be maintained"
      - "Yellow (#FEFF00) reserved for tagline only maintains brand distinction"
      - "Warm dark backgrounds create softer, more approachable feel than pure black"
      - "Subtle gradients with blur effects are modern and should be embraced"
      - "The glass morphism in the icon is current but will age - consider a flatter fallback for longevity"
      - "Display P3 is smart for iOS but remember web needs sRGB fallback (#FEFF00 will be slightly less vibrant)"
      - "Social share cards are well-designed - the glass effect keeps them modern without being gimmicky"
    
    brand_risks_to_watch:
      - "Being lumped in with generic note apps - your messaging must be crystal clear"
      - "Blue accent might feel generic - but it's more accessible than yellow for buttons"
      - "Tech aesthetic might alienate less tech-savvy users - balance with warmth in copy"
      - "Voice-first might make people think it's ONLY voice - clarify hybrid approach"
      - "Glass morphism is trendy now but could date the design - have a refresh plan"
    
    brand_opportunities:
      - "Brain/cognitive science angle - lots of interesting educational content possible"
      - "The ADHD/neurodivergent market could love this (capture without organization burden)"
      - "Partnership opportunities with productivity podcasts, YouTube creators"
      - "The name 'Thoughtmarks' is incredibly searchable and memorable"
      - "Blue accent will work better for accessibility than yellow buttons"
