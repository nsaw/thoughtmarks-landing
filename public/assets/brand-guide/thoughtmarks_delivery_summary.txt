CRITICAL REMINDERS

That Yellow (#FEFF00)
  - It's EXTREMELY saturated (nearly pure yellow)
  - Will be the brightest thing on any screen
  - Perfect for small accents, problematic for large areas
  - Test on multiple devices (OLED vs LCD shows differently)
  - This is your brand identifier - own it completely

The Dark UI
  - Not an option, it's THE brand
  - High contrast with yellow is your aesthetic
  - Reduces eye strain for late-night captures
  - Works with iOS dark mode trends

The Fonts
  - Lato Black for wordmark, ALWAYS all caps
  - Marydale for tagline ONLY, ALWAYS yellow
  - Never swap or substitute these fonts
  - Verify Marydale license for commercial use

The Positioning
  - You're a capture tool, NOT a note app
  - Voice-first is your differentiator
  - Speed > organization in all messaging
  - "NOT another note app" needs to be crystal clear

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT'S STILL NEEDED

Typography
  - Exact Marydale font file and license info
  - Web font versions (WOFF2) for landing page
  - Font specimen showing all weights in use

Vector Assets
  - brain.svg (scalable for web/print)
  - bookmark.svg (scalable for web/print)
  - Logo lockups (horizontal, vertical, icon-only)

Print Assets
  - CMYK color conversions (test yellow on paper)
  - Business card design
  - Letterhead template
  - One-color logo versions (white, black)

Templates
  - Email signature
  - Presentation deck (Keynote/PowerPoint)
  - Social media covers (all platforms)
  - Square social post templates (1:1)

Documentation
  - Animation/motion guidelines
  - Sound design specifications
  - Accessibility testing results

BRAND OPPORTUNITIES YOU SHOULD CONSIDER

ADHD/Neurodivergent Market
  Pain Point: Organization systems are overwhelming
  Your Solution: Capture without organization burden
  Message: "Stop fighting your brain. Start trusting your system."
  
  Why This Works:
  - Your whole brand acknowledges chaos is normal
  - Voice-first reduces friction
  - AI organization means no upfront structure needed
  - This demographic desperately needs what you built
  
  Action: Consider explicit messaging to this market

Productivity Creator Partnerships
  Opportunity: YouTube, podcast, newsletter partnerships
  
  Why This Works:
  - Creators talk about tools constantly
  - Your tool solves a universal problem
  - Voice-first is distinctive enough to demo well
  - "NOT a note app" positioning cuts through noise
  
  Action: Identify productivity creators who aren't already sponsored by Notion/Evernote

Educational Content Strategy
  Opportunity: Brain science, cognitive load, memory
  
  Why This Works:
  - Your brand already uses neurological metaphors
  - Lots of interesting content angles
  - Positions you as thoughtful, not just another tech company
  - Builds trust through education not hype
  
  Action: Blog series or video content on cognitive science of note-taking

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HONEST ASSESSMENT

What's Working
  - That yellow is ballsy and memorable
  - Dark UI is on-trend and functional
  - Glass morphism keeps the icon modern
  - "NOT a note app" positioning is clear
  - Voice-first differentiator is strong
  - Brand personality is consistent and authentic

What to Watch
  - Glass morphism will date (plan refresh in 2-3 years)
  - Yellow is so saturated it might feel harsh on some displays
  - Risk of being lumped with note apps despite messaging
  - Need to keep hammering the differentiation

What to Fix
  - Get those SVG versions made (web needs scalable assets)
  - Document that Marydale license situation
  - Create print-ready versions before you need them
  - Build out the missing template library

FINAL NOTES

You've got a solid brand foundation. The yellow is distinctive, the positioning is clear, and the voice is consistent. The visual identity works well with current iOS design trends while staying true to the core concept.

The biggest opportunity is the ADHD/neurodivergent market - you've accidentally built the perfect tool for people whose brains work exactly the way your messaging acknowledges. Don't sleep on that.

The biggest risk is being lumped with note apps. Every piece of marketing needs to hammer "cognitive capture tool" not "note-taking app."

Now go build SVG versions of that brain and bookmark. You'll need them for the website, and they'll make your life easier when you inevitably need to resize things.
