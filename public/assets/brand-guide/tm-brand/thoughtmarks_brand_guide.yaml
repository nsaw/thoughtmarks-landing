      - "Don't use corporate productivity speak"
      - "Don't make users feel bad about being disorganized"
    
    positioning_donts:
      - "Don't position as 'another note-taking app'"
      - "Don't compare directly to Notion/Evernote (different category)"
      - "Don't emphasize organization over capture"
      - "Don't target 'everyone' - own the niche"
  
  competitive_differentiation:
    not_a_notebook:
      apps: "Notion, Evernote, OneNote"
      difference: "Those require structure upfront. We capture first, organize automatically."
    
    not_a_voice_memo:
      apps: "Apple Voice Memos, Otter"
      difference: "Voice memos become black holes. We transcribe, tag, and make searchable."

      - "Develop icon library for features"
      - "Build out social media templates"
      - "Design merch/swag concepts (stickers, shirts)"

      - "Establish brand guidelines for any contractors/agencies"
      - "Consider sub-brands if expanding product line"
  
  notes_for_founder:
    confirmed_specifications:
      yellow_hex: "#FEFF00 (exact from color palette)"
      color_space: "Display P3 for iOS icon (wider gamut than sRGB)"
      icon_construction: "Multi-layer with blend modes - gradient overlay, glass effects, translucency"
      social_templates: "9:16 Instagram format with glass morphism cards"
      messaging: "Value props and how-it-works flow documented"
      typography: "Sans-serif for UI, Over the Rainbow Regular for tagline only"
    
    remaining_questions:
      - "What's the specific sans-serif font family? (SF Pro for iOS is likely but confirm for web)"
      - "Are there specific error state colors defined beyond the main palette?"
      - "Any animation/motion guidelines for the app?"
      - "Sound design specifications for UI interactions?"
    
    answered_questions:
      tagline_font: "Over the Rainbow Regular (SIL OFL 1.1) - acceptable alternative to Marydale"
    
    recommendations:
      - "That yellow (#FEFF00) is basically pure saturated yellow - it's bold as hell. Own it completely."
      - "The glass morphism in the icon is current but will age - consider a flatter fallback for longevity"
      - "Display P3 is smart for iOS but remember web needs sRGB fallback (#FEFF00 will be slightly less vibrant)"
      - "Social share cards are well-designed - the glass effect keeps them modern without being gimmicky"
      - "Consider registering #FEFF00 as a trademark color - it's distinctive enough"
      - "The multi-layer icon composition is production-grade - document layer order for any redesigns"
    
    brand_risks_to_watch:
      - "Being lumped in with generic note apps - your messaging must be crystal clear"
      - "That yellow is INTENSE - on some displays it might feel harsh. Test across devices."
      - "Tech aesthetic might alienate less tech-savvy users - balance with warmth in copy"
      - "Voice-first might make people think it's ONLY voice - clarify hybrid approach"
      - "Glass morphism is trendy now but could date the design - have a refresh plan"
    
    brand_opportunities:
      - "Brain/cognitive science angle - lots of interesting educational content possible"
      - "The ADHD/neurodivergent market could love this (capture without organization burden)"
      - "Partnership opportunities with productivity podcasts, YouTube creators"
      - "The name 'Thoughtmarks' is incredibly searchable and memorable"
      - "That yellow will pop in the App Store - literally impossible to miss"

  appendix_color_specifications:
    primary_yellow_deep_dive:
      hex: "#FEFF00"
      characteristics:
        - "Near-pure yellow at maximum brightness (254 red, 255 green, 0 blue)"
        - "One of the most saturated yellows possible in RGB space"
        - "Sits at the extreme edge of the color gamut"
        - "Highly visible and attention-grabbing"
        - "Can appear to 'glow' on modern displays"
      
      perceptual_notes:
        - "Extremely high luminance - will be the brightest element on screen"
        - "May appear slightly greenish on some displays due to maxed green channel"
        - "Can cause eye fatigue if overused or in large areas"
        - "Excellent for small accent elements, problematic for large fills"
        - "Works best against very dark backgrounds (#000000 or #181818)"
      
      display_considerations:
        oled: "Will be extremely vibrant, may bloom slightly"
        lcd: "Still very bright but slightly more controlled"
        print: "Requires 100% yellow ink, may need color matching test"
        web_srgb: "Displays accurately in sRGB as it's within gamut"
        display_p3: "Even more vibrant on P3 displays (iPhone X and newer)"
      
      usage_rules:
        do:
          - "Use for CTAs and interactive elements that demand attention"
          - "Use for the bookmark icon element"
          - "Use for tagline text 'bookmarks for your brain!'"
          - "Use sparingly as accent - less than 10% of total composition"
        dont:
          - "Don't use for large background areas (eye strain)"
          - "Don't use for body text (readability issues)"
          - "Don't pair with other bright saturated colors (visual chaos)"
          - "Don't use at 100% opacity on anything except black backgrounds"
      
      accessibility_testing:
        black_background: "AAA contrast (21:1 ratio) - perfect"
        shark_background: "AA contrast (15:1 ratio) - good for large text"
        bombay_gray_text: "Test required - may not meet AA for small text"
        note: "Always test yellow text on specific background before implementation"
    
    print_production:
      note: "Dark-heavy brand means print will be ink-intensive. Consider inverse treatments for certain applications."
      yellow_print_considerations:
        - "Test yellow on various paper stocks - may need adjustment for newsprint vs coated"
        - "100% yellow ink can appear too vibrant - consider 95% for more natural appearance"
        - "Overprinting black + yellow creates green tint - use knockout technique"
        - "Pantone equivalent would be closest to Pantone Yellow C or 012 C (test for best match)"
        - "Spot color printing recommended for brand consistency vs CMYK build"
    
    digital_accessibility:
      wcag_compliance:
        yellow_on_black: "AAA compliant for all text sizes"
        yellow_on_shark: "AA compliant for large text (18pt+)"
        yellow_on_bombay: "Likely fails AA - needs testing with actual hex values"
      
      colorblind_considerations:
        - "Yellow/black works for most colorblind types (protanopia, deuteranopia)"
        - "May be less distinct for tritanopia (blue-yellow colorblindness) - rare but possible"
        - "Circuit gray may be less visible for some - ensure other differentiators (shape, position)"
        - "Consider pattern fills as alternative to color alone for critical information"
    
    screen_color_variation:
      issue: "Yellow displays differently on OLED vs LCD vs print"
      mitigation:
        - "Test on multiple devices during development (iPhone, Android, various monitors)"
        - "Consider slightly desaturated yellow for more consistent appearance (not recommended for brand)"
        - "Use color profiles in assets (sRGB for web, P3 for modern devices)"
        - "Document that #FEFF00 is the canonical color regardless of display variation"
        - "Accept that perfect consistency across all displays is impossible with such saturated yellow"

version_history:
  v1.0: "Initial brand guide compiled from app screenshots and landing page analysis"
  future_updates:
    - "Add exact color specifications once confirmed"
    - "Include typography license details when finalized"
    - "Expand with product screenshots as features launch"
    - "Add competitive analysis as market evolves"
