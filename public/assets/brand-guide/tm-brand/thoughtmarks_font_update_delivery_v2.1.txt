THOUGHTMARKS BRAND GUIDE - COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE
Delivery Summary v3.0
Based on actual deployment at thoughtmarksapp.com

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT CHANGED

Major Corrections from v2.0/v2.1
  The previous brand guides (v2.0, v2.1) incorrectly stated that yellow
  (#FEFF00) was the primary accent color. After reviewing the actual
  deployment at thoughtmarksapp.com, the following corrections were made:
  
  1. PRIMARY ACCENT: Blue (#3B82F6) - NOT yellow
     - Blue is used for all buttons, CTAs, links, focus rings
     - Blue is the primary interactive color throughout the site
     - Yellow is NEVER used for interactive elements
     
  2. YELLOW USAGE: Tagline script text ONLY
     - Yellow (#FEFF00) is ONLY used for "bookmarks for your brain" tagline
     - Always uses Over the Rainbow Regular font
     - Never used for buttons, CTAs, or any interactive elements
     
  3. GRADIENTS: ARE used (contrary to old guide)
     - Gradients are used for background blobs/effects
     - Examples: from-accent/10 to-blue-400/5 (blue gradients)
     - NOT used for buttons (those are solid blue)
     
  4. TYPOGRAPHY: Lato (not generic sans-serif)
     - Primary UI font is Lato (self-hosted)
     - Weights: 300, 400, 700, 900
     - Location: /public/assets/fonts/Lato/
     - Cache busting: URLs include ?cb=v4 parameter
     
  5. BACKGROUNDS: Warm darks (not pure black)
     - Base: #09090B (warm dark, not #000000)
     - Elevated: #18181B (card backgrounds)
     - Surface: #27272A (borders, elevated surfaces)
     
  6. TEXT COLORS: Specific zinc palette
     - Primary: #FAFAFA (Zinc-50)
     - Secondary: #A1A1AA (Zinc-400)
     - Muted: #71717A (Zinc-500)

FILE FORMATS EXPLAINED

SVG vs HTML vs AI/Figma
  
  HTML (old approach):
  ✗ Generic font fallbacks don't render properly
  ✗ Not editable in design software
  ✗ Limited to web browser viewing
  ✗ Print workflow is awkward (print to PDF)
  
  SVG (new approach):
  ✓ Opens directly in Adobe Illustrator
  ✓ Imports to Figma perfectly
  ✓ Fonts embedded and editable
  ✓ Vector format scales to any size
  ✓ Can export to any format (PDF, PNG, etc.)
  ✓ Professional design workflow
  
  Native .AI/.fig files:
  ✗ Require proprietary software to create
  ✗ Can't be generated programmatically
  ✗ SVG serves the same purpose and is more universal

Bottom Line: SVG is the professional standard for design deliverables
that need to work across multiple tools.

HOW TO USE YOUR UPDATED BRAND GUIDE

Step 1: Understand the Corrections
  
  CRITICAL: The previous guides (v2.0, v2.1) were WRONG about:
  - Primary accent color (it's BLUE, not yellow)
  - Yellow usage (tagline ONLY, not buttons)
  - Gradients (they ARE used, for backgrounds)
  - Typography (it's Lato, not generic sans-serif)
  - Backgrounds (warm darks, not pure black)
  
  Always reference v3.0 for accurate specifications.

Step 2: Open the SVG in Your Design Tool
  
  For Adobe Illustrator:
  1. Launch Illustrator
  2. File > Open
  3. Select thoughtmarks_brand_style_guide.svg
  4. All 5 artboards load automatically
  5. Edit text, colors, layouts as needed
  6. Export individual artboards as PDF/PNG
  
  For Figma:
  1. Open Figma in browser or desktop app
  2. Drag thoughtmarks_brand_style_guide.svg into Figma
  3. Or: File > Import > select SVG
  4. All artboards import as frames
  5. Edit using Figma tools
  6. Over the Rainbow font will need to be installed locally
     for full editing (Figma will prompt you)

Step 3: Reference the Documentation
  
  For Quick Lookups:
  - thoughtmarks_brand_standards_quick_ref_v3.0.txt
  - Has all hex codes, font names, basic rules
  
  For Technical Implementation:
  - thoughtmarks_brand_guide.yaml
  - iOS icon specs, layer details, exact values
  
  For Copywriting:
  - thoughtmarks_messaging_framework.txt
  - Voice guidelines, target audiences, messaging

Step 4: Create New Assets
  
  The SVG artboards are templates you can:
  - Duplicate and modify for new layouts
  - Copy color swatches for consistency
  - Reference typography for new designs
  - Export as components for reuse
  
  Remember:
  - Use BLUE (#3B82F6) for all interactive elements
  - Use YELLOW (#FEFF00) ONLY for tagline script text
  - Use warm dark backgrounds (#09090B, #18181B, #27272A)
  - Use Lato for all UI text, Over the Rainbow for tagline only

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TROUBLESHOOTING

If Over the Rainbow Doesn't Display in Figma:
  1. Install font on your computer first
  2. Restart Figma
  3. Figma will prompt to use local font
  4. If still issues, convert text to outlines in Illustrator first

If Lato Doesn't Display:
  1. Install Lato font family on your computer
  2. Restart design application
  3. Fonts are self-hosted, so ensure files are accessible

If SVG Doesn't Open in Illustrator:
  1. Make sure you have Adobe Illustrator (not just Reader)
  2. Try File > Open instead of double-clicking
  3. If "version" error, try Illustrator 2020 or newer
  4. SVG is backwards compatible, so older versions should work

If Colors Look Different:
  - Web browsers use sRGB color space
  - Illustrator/Figma may use RGB or Display P3
  - #3B82F6 (blue) and #FEFF00 (yellow) are the authoritative hex codes
  - Slight variations are normal across color spaces
  - For iOS, use Display P3 profile
  - For web, use sRGB profile

If You Need Another Format:
  - From Illustrator: Save As > PDF/EPS/AI
  - From Figma: Export > PDF/PNG/SVG
  - For contractors: Share view-only link or export PDF

FINAL THOUGHTS

The v2.0 and v2.1 guides had a fundamental flaw - they incorrectly
stated that yellow (#FEFF00) was the primary accent color. After
reviewing the actual deployment at thoughtmarksapp.com, it's clear
that:

1. BLUE (#3B82F6) is the primary interactive color
   - Used for all buttons, CTAs, links, focus rings
   - Professional, trustworthy, accessible
   - High contrast on dark backgrounds

2. YELLOW (#FEFF00) is ONLY for tagline script text
   - Creates memorable brand moment
   - Never used for interactive elements
   - Always uses Over the Rainbow Regular font

3. The warm dark backgrounds (#09090B, #18181B, #27272A) create
   depth without harsh contrast, and work beautifully with the
   blue accent color.

4. Gradients ARE used (contrary to old guide) - but for background
   blobs/effects, not for buttons (which are solid blue).

5. Lato is the professional, readable UI font that works well
   across all platforms.

This v3.0 update corrects all previous errors and provides accurate
specifications based on the actual deployed site. Always reference
v3.0 for brand implementation.
