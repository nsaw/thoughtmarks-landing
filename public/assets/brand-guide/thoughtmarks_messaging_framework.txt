  Voice-first note capture with AI organization
  
What We're Not
  Not another note-taking app (Notion, Evernote)

  Not a task manager (Todoist, Things)
  Not a productivity system (GTD, PARA, etc.)
  
The Category We Created
  Cognitive capture tools
  Speed-of-thought capture meets AI organization
  Zero friction between inspiration and storage

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PRIMARY TAGLINES

  Usage: Always in yellow (#FEFF00) handwritten font (Over the Rainbow)
  Placement: Hero sections, app icon context, marketing materials, social cards

2. "Don't watch another shower thought circle the drain."
   Subhead: "Capture at the speed of life. Find it when you need it."

3. "The notes app for people with great ideas and average memory."
   Subhead: "Life's moving. Your notes should keep up."

4. "Your brain's tired, your ideas shouldn't be."
   Subhead: "Your ideas deserve better than your notes app."

5. "Tip-of-the-tongue, solved."
   Subhead: "For people with a million ideas and zero attention span."

Usage Rules:
  - Last line of headline uses blue accent color (#3B82F6)

HOW IT WORKS (3-STEP FRAMEWORK)

Use this structure for all explanatory content

Step 1: Capture
  "Voice or text in seconds"
  
  Expansion: Background Siri integration, instant VTT (voice-to-text), 
  no friction between idea and storage, works while driving, 
  cooking, walking, whenever inspiration strikes
  
  Feature Copy: "Hands-free capture. Walking the dog. Driving. Cooking. 
  The best ideas hit when your hands are full. Siri grabs it. You keep moving."
  
Step 2: Organize
  "Auto tags, categories, connections"
  
  Expansion: AI analyzes and structures automatically, no folders to manage,
  no tagging systems to maintain, connections between ideas surface naturally,
  organization happens without you thinking about it
  
  Feature Copy: "Smart Bin. Organization without effort. AI-organized categories 
  that learn how you think. No folders required."
  
Step 3: Discover
  "Search by words or meaning"
  
  Expansion: Semantic search understands what you're looking for even if
  you don't remember exact words, find "that quote from that podcast",
  search by context not just keywords, your brain delegates remembering to AI
  
  Feature Copy: "Search by meaning. That thing about systems and stories? Found. 
  You do not need the exact words. Search remembers the vibe."
